# Dotfiles

This is the dotfile I use as my daily driver. It is managed with chezmoi, head over
to their page for learning more about how to use it.

The dotfiles are made for my personel use, hence the scripts and configurations are 
specific to my systems. It, is not that it would not work on your system (rather
I would encorage you to try it.)but it may have some broke parts. But you can configure 
it easily for your needs. The config doesn't think that you have saved few configuration files
in your custom paths but if everything is in its default location, everything should work.

### Tools used

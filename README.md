# Dotfiles

These are the dotfiles I have been using for the past few weeks, I must say it was fun creating
and using your on setup and dotfiles for the first time. I must say that this is fairly new and 
immature repo. Maintained with the help of chezmoi, you can learn more about the amazing project
[here](https://www.chezmoi.io) and can use my dotfiles from [these](https://www.chezmoi.io/user-guide/daily-operations/#install-chezmoi-and-your-dotfiles-on-a-new-machine-with-a-single-command) commands.

This are the dotfile I use as my daily driver. It is managed with chezmoi, head over
to their page for learning more about how to use it.

The dotfiles are made for my personel use, hence the scripts and configurations are 
specific to my systems. It, is not that it would not work on your system (rather
I would encorage you to try it.)but it may have some broke parts. But you can configure 
it easily for your needs. The config doesn't think that you have saved few configuration files
in your custom paths but if everything is in its default location, everything should work.

# Dotfiles

These are the dotfiles I have been using for the past few weeks as my daily driver, I must say it was fun
creating and using your on setup and dotfiles for the first time. It is fairly new and
immature repo. Maintained with the help of chezmoi(great project btw), you can learn more about the amazing
project [here](https://www.chezmoi.io) and can use my dotfiles from [these](https://www.chezmoi.io/user-guide/daily-operations/#install-chezmoi-and-your-dotfiles-on-a-new-machine-with-a-single-command) commands.

> Disclaimer
These dotfiles are not made to be worked for every system. It is just a showcase of my configs, in case
anyone finds something interesting, they can surely adopt it in their files. Still, any suggestions and
improvements are welcomed. Feel free to open an issue.

This commit marks the most baseline workable config without any ricing and future iterations will be a
testimony of how things evolve in commparison to, this commit.
